## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data was collected from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

The main objetive here is trying to predicti Breast Cancer Occurrence with Machine Learning in R.

## Solution Strategy
For that, I used RStudio.
* Step 01: Collecting and Pre-Processing the Data;
* Step 02: Adjusting the target variable and Normalizing the data;
* Step 03: Training the model with KNN;
* Step 04: Optimizing Model Performance;
* Step 05: Building a model with Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM);
* Step 06: Building a model with Random Forest Algorithm.


## Next Steps
* Improve the parameters.
* Understand the correlation between variables.

## Disclaimer 
A good part of this project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning course (part of the Data Scientist training)
